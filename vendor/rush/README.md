# rush

[![CI](https://github.com/rockorager/rush/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rockorager/rush/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Rush is a POSIX shell with dash-class speed, Bash-shaped conveniences, async
prompts, autosuggestions, and a modern interactive editor.

Keep portable scripts boring. Make daily command lines pleasant with
Unicode-aware editing, fast searchable history, structured completions,
non-blocking prompt data, and terminal-native rendering.

## Highlights

- `rush --posix` targets POSIX.1-2024 / Issue 8 shell semantics, including the
  shell language, expansion, redirection, job control, and builtins.
- Default Rush keeps valid POSIX scripts meaningful while accepting selected
  Bash-shaped extensions for migration and interactive use.
- Emacs and vi editing modes, styled diagnostics, fish-style abbreviations,
  structured completions, and history-backed autosuggestions are built in.
- Prompt segments can fetch Git state, tool versions, or project metadata in
  the background while the editor remains responsive.
- Command history is stored in SQLite with full-text search, timestamps,
  status, duration, hostname, session, and current-directory context.
- Rush probes terminal capabilities and uses synchronized output, Unicode
  grapheme widths, bracketed paste, modern keys, and color-scheme reports when
  available.

Rush targets POSIX-like systems first: Linux, macOS, and BSDs.

## Build and install

Rush requires Zig 0.16. The repository includes `mise.toml` for `mise` users,
and Zig fetches the declared dependencies from `build.zig.zon`. SQLite is built
from the bundled amalgamation by default; packagers can opt into system SQLite
with `-fsys=sqlite3`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rockorager/rush
cd rush
zig build
zig build install --prefix "$HOME/.local" -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

Arch Linux users can install the latest development revision from the AUR:

```sh
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/rush-shell-git.git
cd rush-shell-git
makepkg -si
```

The package is named `rush-shell-git` to distinguish it from the existing GNU
Restricted User Shell package, which also installs `/usr/bin/rush`. A future
tagged-release package can use the corresponding `rush-shell` name.

Common build options:

- `-Dsysconfdir=/etc` sets the system configuration directory. The default is
  `<prefix>/etc`.
- `-Dregister-shell=false` skips adding the installed executable to
  `/etc/shells`; package builds should use this option.
- `-fsys=sqlite3` links against system SQLite instead of the bundled
  amalgamation.
- `-Dtarget=...` cross-compiles.
- `-Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding` builds the embeddable wasm module instead of
  the native executable and `librush`.
- `-Dlto=none|thin|full` sets link-time optimization. The default is `none`.

The install includes `rush(1)` for command usage and `rush(5)` for interactive
configuration and prompts. Run `man rush` or `man 5 rush` after installation.

## Library

`zig build` also installs `librush`, the embeddable shell:

```text
zig-out/lib/librush.a
zig-out/lib/librush.so (or librush.dylib on macOS)
zig-out/include/rush.h
```

Use `zig build lib` to build only those artifacts. The library runs the shell
language and builtins in-process. External commands return 127; pipelines,
subshells, and job control are unavailable.

See `include/rush.h` and `src/c_api.zig` for the C ABI, pointer lifetimes, and
EXIT-trap rules.

## WebAssembly

```sh
zig build -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
```

This installs `zig-out/bin/rush.wasm`, a no-entry module with the same C ABI as
`librush`. Instantiate it with no imports; `memory` and the `rush_*` exports
are enough.

## Run

```sh
zig build run
zig build run -- -c 'echo hello'
./zig-out/bin/rush --help
```

Supported CLI forms:

```text
rush [-l | --login] [--posix] [-i] [-u] [-x]
rush [--posix] [-i] [-u] [-x] -c SCRIPT [NAME [ARGS...]]
rush [--posix] [-i] [-u] [-x] [--] SCRIPT_FILE [ARGS...]
rush --help
rush --version
```

`--posix` selects strict POSIX mode. Default Rush starts from the same POSIX
core and enables selected compatibility and interactive features.

## Test and validation

```sh
zig fmt --check build.zig build.zig.zon src tests fuzz
zig build compile-check
zig build lint
zig build test
zig build conformance
```

GitHub Actions runs these checks for every pull request and push to `main`.

## Configuration

Interactive startup sources Rush scripts in this order:

```text
embedded default configuration
$ENV
$sysconfdir/rush/profile.rush      (login shells only)
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rush/profile.rush (login shells only)
$sysconfdir/rush/config.rush
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rush/config.rush
```

If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset, user files fall back to
`$HOME/.config/rush/`. The embedded defaults come from
[`share/rush/config.rush`](share/rush/config.rush) and define prompt defaults,
style defaults, and `ll`/`la` abbreviations that later config files can
override or erase. Rush-mode shells also autoload functions from
`rush/functions` search directories when a matching function name is used;
shipped defaults include colorized `ls`/`grep`/`diff` helpers, `path_*` PATH
helpers, and opt-in project-environment hooks there.

More configuration and prompt examples are in
[`website/docs/configuration.html`](website/docs/configuration.html) and
[`website/docs/features.html`](website/docs/features.html).
